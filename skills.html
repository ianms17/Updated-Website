                    The whole world of Computer Science interests me. I feel like
                    I find enjoyment in all of the things that I study. That being
                    said, there are a few areas that stand out to me. First is web
                    development. Full stack development so far has been fun. I did
                    a group project using Django and I fell in love with it. Another
                    big area for me is Cybersecurity. I have always been fascinated
                    by networking and the internet, and when I started learning about
                    security protocols and encyption and cyber attacks I just became
                    enthralled. Beyond those, I am also interested in learning more
                    about App Development, Data Science and Machine Learning, and
                    Human-Computer Interaction.

                <p>
                    When it comes to programming, I am proficient in C++, Python, and Java,
                    with C++ and Python being my strongest languages. I also have
                    experience with functional programming in Scheme, as well as front end
                    work in HTML/CSS. I also have experience working with Django, as well
                    as PostgreSQL and MySQL, and I am comfortable using Git and GitHub. In
                    terms of development methodologies, I have a good understanding of Agile
                    as I have experience managing an Agile Project. I am also capable of
                    programming at the Operating System level, and I have experience using
                    threads and sockets in Linux with C++. There's also still a ton of
                    stuff that I have yet to learn, but I feel that I have really solid CS
                    fundamentals and I am able to learn new things quickly.
