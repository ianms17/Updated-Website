                <p>
                    My name is Ian Stephenson. I was born in Houston, Texas and have lived here for most
                    of my life, and I also lived in the Chicago area for a few years of my life as well.
                    I'm working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity
                    with the hopes of starting a career in Software Development when I graduate. Right now, I
                    work as a Peer Teacher for ENGR 102, an introductory programming experience for freshman
                    engineering students. My job is basically to teach the basics of Python, and to help
                    students to debug or fix their code whenever they are stuck.
                </p>

                    Some of my favorite things in the world are sports. As I mentioned, I lived in Chicago right around the time
                    I was getting into sports so I'm a big fan of both the Bears and Cubs. I'm also a big gamer, as I have been
                    for basically my whole life. If you like The Witcher, Skyrim, or Civilization then you're a friend of
                    mine. Golfing is another hobby of mine. I've been playing since I was about 14 and I competed in high
                    school, and I love to get out and play whenever I can. Lastly, I really enjoy playing
                    chess, and I'm always down for a game so hit me up and we'll play.
                </p>
